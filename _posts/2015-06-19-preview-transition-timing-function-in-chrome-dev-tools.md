I'm pretty sure a lot of people ask themselves how all these <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transition-timing-function.asp" target="_blank">transition-timing-functions</a> work and what is the difference in using them.

Things are getting easier as Chrome gives you an awesome built-in tool that allows to play around with all the available functions.

Timing function previewer opens up on the icon clicking and it is super easy to use.

I think from now I will use some other functions apart from _ease-in_ and _linear_ :)
